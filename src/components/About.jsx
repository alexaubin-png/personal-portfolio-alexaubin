      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p className='About-Paragraph'>At 22 years old, hailing from a small town in Vermont, I ventured into programming initially drawn by the lucrative prospects it offers. Over time, my journey has been enriched by a deep-seated passion for computersâ€”an admiration stemming from their complexity and transformative power. Beyond coding, I find joy in snowboarding, relishing the thrill of gliding down slopes, and cherish moments spent with friends, whose company adds vibrancy to my life.</p>
